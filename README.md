# cpp-class-creator README

forked from [https://github.com/tzAcee/cpp-class-creator](https://github.com/tzAcee/cpp-class-creator), thanks for the author.

add some features:
* always make root path as default location
* creat .h instead of .hpp
* add header guard to .h
* format might be a little tidier

ps: some features for own fast use, might broke the original function, so it is not ready to create a pull request and not ready to publish to VS Code market.

## Features

Press **Alt**+**X** to open the Input Field to create a class, <span style="color:red">**while you are focusing the editor!**</span>

Type in the name, and there you go. You will directly see, when the file is created.

Additionaly you can set the path where the file has to be created: check Settings at the bottom.

## Known Issues

-Class can be created, while the language is not c++

## Settings
"cpp.sfml.*" - Experimental, not really usefull, just for my private usage

"cpp.creator.setPath": = "string" | null : set your path where the class should be created
